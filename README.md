The TRES video game.

## Coding via Discord

We developing our game, while chatting on Discord.
To join, send Richel a Discord Friend Request: `richelbilderbeek#9002`.
He'll add you to the tresinformal server.

See this video for an introduction: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/zyn5VyNjz5I) [download (.OGG)](http://richelbilderbeek.nl/dutch_by_kids_students.ogv)

## Game: 2D PvP chasing game

A game where you are on a 2D surface with heterogeneous characteristics, as different terrains, resources etc. You start with a very small particle-like character, as you play you can gather resources scattered around and increase your size/mass, the more you grow the more your options increase(you can change shape, what matter composes you etc.), other players roam around as you do increasing size and having more options as they progress. The goal is to chase and eliminate the other players. It would be good to have multiple conditions(you have to be bigger, you need to be made of a certain material etc.) you need to satisfy to be able to eliminate the other players.e.

## [Installation](install.md)

See [install.md](install.md).

## Links

https://agar.io/, this game could give a good idea of how we would like this game to work. The game we think about though should allow more variation in determining how you grow and/or change shape, as well as could require different conditions than just being bigger than the other player to eliminate it.

## I am a newbie developer. What must I do?

Welcome to the team! Here is a more-or-less-chronological (i.e. if you
get stuck, start working on the next one) list what to do:

 * [Become a tresinformal team member](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/1)
 * [Install Qt Creator and SFML](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/16)
 * [Modify fairytale on master branch](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/19)
 * [Make a branch for yourself via the GitHub web interface](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/47)
 * [Modify the fairytale on your local harddrive on your own branch](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/48)
 * [Add your branch's badges to the README.md](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/87)

When you feel comfortable with the workflow, you become a junior developer!

## I am a junior developer, what should I do?

Junior developers are those that feel comfortable enough with the workflow
to write their own tests. Next to programming, juniors will
occasionally teach newbies.

Start from an idea of a visible change in the game,
for example, 'The players should be able to do a little dance'.
Create an Issue for that and assign yourself to it
Work from big to small, in TDD fashion.

For a big Issue:

 * Postpone the hard work, create simpler and simpler tests, 
   until a test can be fixed by a small Issue.
 * Do push the #IFDEF-ed tests

For a small Issue:

 * Write a test that breaks the build
 * Make the test pass
 * Push to GitLab

Golden rules:

 * Whatever you work on, always be assigned to an Issue
 * Whatever code you develop, always be working to fix a test,
   unless you work on graphics
 * If all tests pass, we are -by definition- happy.

## I am a medior developer, what should I do?

Medior developers are those that see the bigger picture
of the code and the team. Next to programming, mediors will
occasionally teach juniors.

You know what to do :+1:
