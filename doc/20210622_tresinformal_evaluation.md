Analysis by Richel.

# Social

## Tops

 * Focus on fun, instead of productivity
 * Pokemon games
 * Chats before and during breaks
 * No pressure on release version
 * Creative freedom
 * Gezelligheid
 * Strict time schedule
 * Great team spirit

## Tips

 * Team could be present earlier to have a longer chat before starting
 * Members silencing another member should never happen, not even as a joke

## Interpretation by Richel

I am happy to get this feedback, as it is what I want to achieve:
an informal setting. And apparently not too informal, as there is 
a thirst to chat more before the event.
I did have my worries about the chat in the break, as I am
unsure if everyone is a fan of the love for Pokemon in the group,
yet apparently the Digimon lovers don't mind.

I am pleased to read the tip 'Members silencing another member should never 
happen, not even as a joke'. I have added the Discord rule to the README, 
will discuss it today and enforce it -together with the team- from then on.

# Workflow

## Tops

 * Having defined issues to work on  
 * Pair programming  
 * Good workflow, everything should be kept this way  
 * Freedom to choose issues  
 * Writing tests  
 * Workflow is clear and beneficial for beginners  
 * Freedom to write issues

## Tips

 * Cheat sheet for Git
 * More independence to work on issues
 * The focus or direction of the team could be improved by implementing primary goals
 * Couples should be shuffled more often
 * More focus on theoretical knowledge
 * More medior members

## Interpretation by Richel

Here we see some different perspectives from the team members.
I am very happy to read that all parts of the workflow are appreciated
by at least one team member. 

We see one team member enjoying the
pair programming, another wants to work more independently and another
wants to switch more often. That is a hard problem to solve :-)

As a first attempt, I made Discord categories: 'Group Rooms',
'Offices With An Open Door' (i.e. single room, open for questions), 
and 'Offices With A Closed Door' (i.e. single room, please do not disturb).
I have set the number of channels as such that I feel is optimal for the
team.

I created an Issue to add a git cheat sheet at
 https://github.com/tresinformal/game/issues/342 :-)

I think 'The focus or direction of the team could be improved by 
implementing primary goals' is interesting. From my point of view,
'building up experience on your own level' is one of my primary goals,
of which I think is already implemented and enjoyed by the team (as can
be seen in this form as well). Maybe these primary goals
are related to the game, so I put a new Super Mario Land map in the 
GitHub repo and on the Discord. Still, that may not be what this
team member wants. I feel this team members wants something like a 
game director, to determine the course of the game. Let's
have a meeting today on that!

# Discord

## Tops

 * Table configuration
 * Discord is nice

## Tips

 * Important messages are lost in the chat, this could be solved by having a new text channel for those specifically

## Interpretation by Richel

Created a channel called 'Important stuff' and pinned the last note.

# Pavel

## Tips

 * Enthusiastic  
 * Me smash  
 * Helpful
 * Knowledgeable
 * Fun to work with
 * Positive

## Tops

 * Me destroy
 * Too eager to solve an issue yourself, so less experienced members don’t have the chance

## Interpretation by Richel

I am happy to see Pavel is appreciated as such and I agree with
his eagerness. Where I enjoy this feature myself, I can
also imagine this is less fun as a beginner being paired
with him. I predict this will fade with experience :-)

# Richel

## Tops

 * Helpful
 * Guidance
 * Consistency
 * Experienced
 * Good organization
 * Funny
 * Nice that you check in now and then
 * Helps members to grow professionally by encouraging to try new things
 * Knowledgeable
 * Patient

## Tips

 * Sometimes too strict time management, can be a annoying
 * Monthly briefing on project progress

## Interpretation by Richel

I am happy to get back the traits that I try to express.
Note that one team member enjoys the strict time management,
where here one team highlights its disadvantages.
I think a good compromise would be to maintain a strict schedule,
yet enforce it less, i.e. not telling people repeatedly that
it is time/break.

# Stefano

## Tops

 * Fun to work with  
 * Passionate  
 * Experienced
 * Learning on his own
 * Knowledgeable
 * Funny
 * Helpful

## Tips

 * Should be more consistent
 * Don’t be late

## Interpretation by Richel

I am happy to see Stefano is appreciated as such
and is wanted that much. I am unsure if the team is asking
too much of our frivolous Italian to be on time :-)
