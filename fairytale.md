# Fairytale

Once upon a time there was a dragon and a toothfairy.

Plotwist!!! They were both horses in disguise!
They drank a lot of beer and rode into the sunset..
And went on until sunrise...
which is troublesome as it was winter and they were in North Finland...
and they lived happily until their livers collapsed..

Eventually, the universe aged and entropy ripped them apart!
