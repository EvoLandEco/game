# Fairytale

Once upon a time there was a dragon and a toothfairy and a goblin.

They were both horses in disguise!

They drank a lot of beer and flew into the sun

The sun was very hot and would burn anything and anyone to a crisp, but as they are magical creatures, they were not harmed.

and they lived happily ever after (maybe).
which is troublesome as it was winter and they were in North Finland...
and they lived happily until their livers collapsed..


Until the universe aged and entropy ripped the rest of 
their bodies apart!

Anticlimcatic you may think
