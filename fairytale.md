# Fairytale

Once upon a time there was a dragon and a toothfairy.

Plotwist!!! They were both horses in disguise!
They drank a lot of beer and rode into the sunset..
And went on until sunrise...
Sometimes, they got super fancy and drank wine instead
And went on until sundawn...
and they lived happily ever after (maybe).
which is troublesome as it was winter and they were in North Finland...
and they lived happily until their livers collapsed..
And sunset again...
and they lived happily ever after.
Eventually, the universe aged and entropy ripped them apart!
Until the universe aged and entropy ripped them apart!
